Notes on implementing queues.

See TR91-04.pdf for Lisp notes on queues. (Old notes A-46)

This article (part 3) discussed TCONC data structure (tail concatenate) which keeps pointers to both front and rear of the queue.

PAIP pg. 342 discusses the same material (Norvig co-authored the technical report above). Wilenksy pg. 273 also discusses TCONCs. Furthermore, the book _Mastering Algorithms with Perl_ (pg. 52) effectively implements a queue using a TCONC without explicitly naming it.

Another family of queues is used in functional programming. These are "persistent" queues that don't rely on side effects. Consequently, the old queue is still available even after an enqueue/dequeue operations, which share structure. CTMCP introduces such queues in Oz in section 3.4.5 (pg. 145) (Especially pg. 147).

CTMCP references Okasaki's book.
